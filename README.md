# Introduction

Based off of the [elixir base image](https://hub.docker.com/_/elixir) this image uses debian as a base for your phoenix applications.

Dockerhub URL: https://hub.docker.com/r/edwinthinks/phoenix-docker

# Usage
This is suitable for those that perhaps rely on some dependencies that you could not get using [bitwalker/alpine-elixir-phoenix](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitwalker/alpine-elixir-phoenix). I recommend using [bitwalker/alpine-elixir-phoenix](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitwalker/alpine-elixir-phoenix) as it is smaller and well supported if you don't need the debian as a base.
